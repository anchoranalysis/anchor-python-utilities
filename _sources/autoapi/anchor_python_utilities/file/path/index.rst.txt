.. py:function:: path_same_directory(path_file: str, filename: str) -> str

   A path to a file existing in the same directory as the executing script.

   It is often convenient to call with :const:`__file__` as the first
   parameter, in order to locate a file on the file-system.

   :param path_file: a path to the file that exists in some directory.
   :param filename: the filename to assign in the outputted path.

   :returns: a path to a file with the directory of :code:`path_file` with `filename` appended.
